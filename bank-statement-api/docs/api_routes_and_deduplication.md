# API Routes and Deduplication Implementation

This document summarizes the changes made to fix API routes and implement transaction deduplication in the Bank Statement API project.

## 1. API Routes Configuration

### Problem
The API routes were incorrectly configured with double prefixes, causing endpoints to be inaccessible.

### Solution
- Added prefixes directly to each router in their respective files:
  - Added `prefix="/categories"` to the categories router
  - Added `prefix="/transactions"` to the transactions router
  - Added `prefix="/upload"` to the upload router
  - Added `prefix="/sources"` to the sources router
- Removed prefixes from the main app's `include_router` calls to avoid double-prefixing

### Code Changes
In `src/app/main.py`:
```python
# Before
app.include_router(categories.router, prefix="/categories", tags=["categories"])
app.include_router(transactions.router, prefix="/transactions", tags=["transactions"])
app.include_router(upload.router, prefix="/upload", tags=["upload"])
app.include_router(sources.router, prefix="/sources", tags=["sources"])

# After
app.include_router(categories.router)
app.include_router(transactions.router)
app.include_router(upload.router)
app.include_router(sources.router)
```

In router files (e.g., `src/app/routes/categories.py`):
```python
router = APIRouter(
    prefix="/categories",
    tags=["categories"],
)
```

## 2. Test Configuration

### Problem
Tests were failing because the test client was not using the same database session as the test fixtures.

### Solution
- Created a `conftest.py` file to centralize test setup:
  - Set up an in-memory SQLite database for testing
  - Created fixtures for database sessions
  - Configured dependency overrides to ensure the test client uses the test database
- Updated test files to use the new testing approach

### Key Components
The `conftest.py` file includes:
- Database setup with SQLite in-memory for testing
- Test fixtures for database sessions
- Dependency overrides for the FastAPI app

## 3. Transaction Deduplication

### Problem
The system needed a way to prevent duplicate transactions when uploading bank statements.

### Initial Approach
- Implemented a normalization function for transaction descriptions
- Added deduplication logic in the upload endpoint using SQL functions
- Added tracking of skipped duplicates

### Improved Approach
- Added a `normalized_description` field to the Transaction model
- Created a database migration for the new field
- Centralized the normalization logic
- Simplified the duplicate detection query

### Code Changes

#### Transaction Model
```python
class Transaction(Base):
    __tablename__ = "transactions"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    date = Column(Date, index=True)
    description = Column(String)
    normalized_description = Column(String, index=True)  # Added field
    amount = Column(Numeric(10, 2))
    category_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("categories.id"), nullable=True)
    currency = Column(String, default="EUR")
    source_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("sources.id"), nullable=False, index=True)
```

#### Normalization Function
```python
def normalize_description(description):
    if not description:
        return ""
    # Convert to lowercase
    normalized = description.lower()
    # Remove punctuation
    normalized = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', normalized)
    # Remove extra whitespace
    normalized = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', normalized).strip()
    return normalized
```

#### Deduplication Logic
```python
# Check for duplicates using the normalized_description field
existing_transaction = db.query(Transaction).filter(
    Transaction.date == transaction_date,
    Transaction.amount == amount,
    Transaction.source_id == source_id,
    Transaction.normalized_description == normalized_description
).first()

if existing_transaction:
    skipped_count += 1
    continue
```

#### Creating Transactions with Normalized Description
```python
new_transaction = Transaction(
    date=transaction_date,
    description=description,
    normalized_description=normalized_description,
    amount=amount,
    source_id=source_id
)
```

## 4. Categorizer Enhancement

### Problem
The transaction categorizer needed to support the new upload flow.

### Solution
- Added a `categorize` method to the `TransactionCategorizer` class
- This method returns a Category object instead of just a category name

### Code Changes
```python
def categorize(self, description: str) -> Optional[Category]:
    """
    Categorize a transaction description and return the Category object.
    
    Args:
        description: The transaction description
        
    Returns:
        The Category object or None if no match is found
    """
    category_name = self.categorize_transaction(description)
    if category_name:
        return self.get_or_create_category(category_name)
    return None
```

## 5. Pydantic Update

### Problem
The code was using a deprecated Pydantic method.

### Solution
- Updated from `from_orm` to `model_validate` with `from_attributes=True`
- Follows the recommended approach for Pydantic v2

### Code Changes
```python
# Before
transaction_schemas = [TransactionSchema.from_orm(t) for t in transactions]

# After
transaction_schemas = [TransactionSchema.model_validate(t, from_attributes=True) for t in transactions]
```

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Correct API Routing**: All endpoints are now correctly accessible with their intended paths.
2. **Reliable Testing**: Tests now accurately reflect the application's behavior.
3. **Efficient Deduplication**: Duplicate transactions are prevented with an optimized approach.
4. **Maintainable Code**: Normalization logic is centralized and consistent.
5. **Improved Database Schema**: The database schema now properly reflects the application's data model.
6. **Modern Dependencies**: Updated to use the latest Pydantic v2 approach.

## Future Considerations

1. **Bulk Operations**: Consider implementing bulk operations for better performance with large datasets.
2. **Enhanced Normalization**: The normalization algorithm could be refined based on specific transaction patterns.
3. **Migration Strategy**: When deploying, ensure existing transactions have their `normalized_description` field populated.
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the performance of the deduplication process with large datasets.
5. **User Feedback**: Consider providing more detailed feedback about skipped duplicates to users.

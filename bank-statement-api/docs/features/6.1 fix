A few things to change:

1. The column_hash column in statement_schema tableshould be called statement_hash
2, it should be build with the columns names of the statement and the file type
3. The statement_schema table should have only the statement_hash column and a json column with the StatementSchema 
4. It looks like statement_upload_service and statement_analysis_service contains some dummy classes, like StatementRepository and TransactionsRepository
